  <h1>How Symmetry Changes Sudoku</h1>
  <p><strong>By Mo Rahman</strong></p>

  <p>Sudoku may look like a simple logic puzzle, but behind every completed grid is a rich combinatorial structure. In this project, I explored how adding symmetry constraints to a 6×6 Sudoku grid dramatically changes the number of valid solutions.</p>

  <p>A standard 6×6 Sudoku uses the digits 1 through 6 and is divided into 2×3 sub-blocks. It is known that there are exactly <strong>282,009,600</strong> valid solutions. Rather than counting all of them, I asked a different question: <em>what happens if we deliberately restrict the grid by requiring symmetry?</em></p>

  <h2>The Central Question</h2>
  <p>My project focused on the following question:</p>
  <blockquote>In how many ways can a 6×6 Sudoku grid be completed when symmetry constraints are imposed?</blockquote>
  <p>I studied two types of symmetry:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical (mirror) symmetry</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Main-diagonal symmetry</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For each case, I examined how symmetry pairs cells together and how those pairings interact with the standard Sudoku rules.</p>

  <h2>Vertical vs. Diagonal Symmetry</h2>
  <p>Under vertical symmetry, each cell on the left side of the grid is paired with a corresponding cell on the right. This reduces the number of independent choices from 36 cells to <strong>18 degrees of freedom</strong>. Many partial grids that look valid fail immediately once mirrored, because the reflection creates conflicts in rows, columns, or blocks.</p>

  <p>Diagonal symmetry behaves differently. Cells along the main diagonal are fixed under reflection, while the remaining cells form symmetric pairs. This leaves <strong>21 degrees of freedom</strong>, making diagonal symmetry slightly less restrictive than vertical symmetry.</p>

  <p>Comparing these cases showed that symmetry doesn’t just “simplify” Sudoku — it introduces new dependencies that drastically shrink the solution space.</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>Symmetry affects Sudoku in two stages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Before applying Sudoku rules, symmetry reduces the number of independent cells.</li>
    <li>After applying rules, symmetry causes constraints to interact aggressively, eliminating large families of configurations.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This explains why symmetric Sudoku solutions are much rarer than standard ones.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This project showed me that familiar puzzles can become genuine research problems when examined through a combinatorial lens. Symmetry, often associated with simplicity, can actually create deeper and more interesting structure.</p>

  <p>If you enjoy Sudoku, try designing a symmetric puzzle yourself — you might discover just how much mathematics is hidden behind a single grid.</p>
