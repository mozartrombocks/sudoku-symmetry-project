How Symmetry Changes Sudoku

By Mo Rahman

Sudoku may look like a simple logic puzzle, but behind every completed grid is a rich combinatorial structure. In this project, I explored how adding symmetry constraints to a 6×6 Sudoku grid dramatically changes the number of valid solutions.
A standard 6×6 Sudoku uses the digits 1 through 6 and is divided into 2×3 sub-blocks. It is known that there are exactly 282,009,600 valid solutions. Rather than counting all of them, I asked a different question: what happens if we deliberately restrict the grid by requiring symmetry?

The Central Question
My project focused on the following question:
  In how many ways can a 6×6 Sudoku grid be completed when symmetry constraints are imposed?

I studied two types of symmetry:
  Vertical (mirror) symmetry
  Main-diagonal symmetry

For each case, I examined how symmetry pairs cells together and how those pairings interact with the standard Sudoku rules.

Vertical vs. Diagonal Symmetry
  Under vertical symmetry, each cell on the left side of the grid is paired with a corresponding cell on the right. This reduces the number of independent choices from 36 cells to 18 degrees of freedom. However, many partial grids that look valid fail immediately once mirrored, because the reflection creates conflicts in rows, columns, or blocks.

  Diagonal symmetry behaves differently. Cells along the main diagonal are fixed under reflection, while the remaining cells form symmetric pairs. This leaves 21 degrees of freedom, making diagonal symmetry slightly less restrictive than vertical symmetry.

  Comparing these cases showed that symmetry doesn’t just “simplify” Sudoku — it introduces new dependencies that drastically shrink the solution space.

What I Learned
One of the most surprising results of this project was how quickly symmetry eliminates valid configurations. Even small constraints propagate across the grid and force contradictions much earlier than expected. This made it clear that symmetric Sudoku puzzles are far rarer than standard ones.

More broadly, this project showed me how familiar puzzles can become genuine research problems when viewed through a combinatorial lens. Symmetry, often associated with simplicity, can actually create deeper and more interesting structure.

If you enjoy Sudoku, try designing a symmetric puzzle yourself — you might discover just how much mathematics is hidden behind a single grid.
